PDF_FILE_HEADER=The first line of a PDF file shall be a header consisting of the 5 characters %PDF\u2013 followed by a version number of the form 1.N, where N is a digit between 0 and 7.
PDF_INDIRECT_OBJECT=Any object in a PDF file may be labelled as an indirect object. This gives the object a unique object identifier by which other objects can refer to it (for example, as an element of an array or as the value of a dictionary entry).
PDF_CROSS_REFERENCE_TABLE=The cross-reference table contains information that permits random access to indirect objects within the file so that the entire file need not be read to locate any particular object.
PDF_CROSS_REFERENCE_TABLE_KEY='n': an in-use entry; 'f': a free entry. There are two kinds of cross-reference entries: one for objects that are in use and another for objects that have been deleted and therefore are free. Both types of entries have similar basic formats, distinguished by the keyword n (for an in-use entry) or f (for a free entry).
